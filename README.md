# Currency-Convertor
A simple app that converts between currencies, it was written with python
The gui was made using PAGE gui generator or designer that uses tkinter
to generate guis. The app is not yet that perfected but it can run and 
work like any other python script. The only error actually is the errors
caused by switching and destroying the two tkinter gui's that are used.
Other wise than that there are no bugs that I have come across so far.
Anyone can edit and make the app better and you can simply email me at 
alinaswe45@gmail.com for any improvements or suggestions. Have a nice 
time converting between currencies.
#FYI I really want someone to help me with gui bug issue
#P.S run the app using an interpreter its not yet executable
#The app needs some external modules:
1.cryptography
2.pyperclip
3.requests
